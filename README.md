# IGN Code Foo - Internship Application

This code was written by Riley Meyerkorth.

## What is it?

This is a poll component that I wrote in ReactJS. It utilizes a JSON file as placeholder server data. It stores the poll data inside that JSON file, and creates a component that users can submit their votes to on certain questions. I tried to make each component and subcomponent as customizable as I could for any situation. I set main style guides for each element of the component within a "poll" CSS stylesheet.

## Personal Experience

This was quite an interesting challenge for me. I have some experience in React, but definetely not as much experience as I do in something like Python. It was honestly a fun experience to solve issues as they arose, and eventually come to build something that I am proud of (especially in the time frame that I worked on it).
